                        <h3>The 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
                                through early and continuous delivery
                                of valuable software.</li>
                            <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
                                development. Agile processes harness change for
                                the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
                            <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a
                                couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
                                preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
                            <li>Business people and developers must work
                                together daily throughout the project.</li>
                            <li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
                                Give them the environment and support they need,
                                and trust them to get the job done.</li>
                            <li>The most efficient and effective method of
                                conveying information to and within a development
                                team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
                            <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                            <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
                                The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
                                to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
                            <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence
                                and good design enhances agility.</li>
                            <li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
                                of work not done--is essential.</li>
                            <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
                                emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
                            <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
                                to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
                                its behavior accordingly.</li>

                        <h3>What does working <i>Agile</i> mean?</h3>
                        <p class="centerText">Working agile is something that has been becoming more popular over the
                            recent years. And
                            working agile means you follow a set of principles and methods within program development
                            and project management.
                            These principles and methods aim to increase flexibility, cooperation and keeping a focus on
                            customer needs. Agile methods value the <b>individuals</b> and <b>interactions</b> in front
                            of proccesses and tools, <b>working software</b> in front of extensive documentation,
                            <b>customer cooperation</b> in front of contract negotation and <b>adjustement to change</b>
                            in front of following a plan. This doesn't mean you don't value the other points but you
                            put an emphasis on the ones mentioned.

                                <h4>How do you work agile?</h4>
                                <p class="centerText">
                                    When working agile there are many different approaches. There are methods such as
                                    Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming(XP) and many more. Depending on your context and
                                    needs you will have to pick the most suitable method, or you can combine several of
                                    them to tailor to your needs. To work agile there are a few key things your must do
                                    in order to prepare. I will describe this process as how it can be used using SCRUM
                                    as the method of agile work.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Scrum Preparation</h4>
                                <p class="centerText">
                                    Firstly you need to gather a SCRUM team. This team will be composed of a SCRUM
                                    master who oversees the workflow and makes sure you stay aligned to the method.
                                    There will also be the productowner who maintains contact with the client and
                                    align your goals with the client needs. He will also be the one keeping in touch
                                    with the client. And lastly you'll have the product developers, who are the
                                    actualy employees developing the solution for the client.<br><br>
                                    Secondly you'll need to start planning what needs to be done, you'll oversee
                                    the clients needs and what they want the final product to be like. Using this
                                    information you'll create a product backlog which will contain everything that
                                    needs to be done in order for the project to be finished. You'll also need to
                                    prioritise these tasks after what's most essential to the client and getting a
                                    working product.

                            <h2>Scrum Workflow</h2>
                            <p class="centerText">
                                At the start of the scrum cycle you walk through the Product Backlog and put the most
                                important things to the product at the top of the list to be done, you'll also be
                                assigning
                                the different tasks estimated timepoints (which is how long you estimate it'll take to
                                complete that specific task). You'll be working in shorts sprints with your team about
                                2-4
                                weeks long and in preparation for these sprints you'll transfer the most important tasks
                                from the product backlog to the Sprint backlog. Planning the sprint you'll be assigning
                                the
                                different tasks to your teammembers based on previous experience of tasks with the same
                                background.<br><br>
                                Then the team will go forward with the sprint and work with the different tasks assigned
                                to
                                them. There'll be daily meetings to keep the team synchronized and talk through any
                                difficulties or problems that arises in the current tasks. During these meetings the
                                teammembers will answer the following questions: "What did i do yesterday", "What am i
                                doing
                                today" and "Are there any obstacles".<br><br>
                                After every sprint is finished there will be a sprint review where the team presents the
                                work they've done for the productowner and others involved that'll give feedback. After
                                that
                                it'll be decided if it was a successful sprint or not.
                                There'll also be a sprint retrospective where the team reflects over what went well and
                                the
                                cooperation during the sprint. The goal being to define what can be done better in the
                                next
                                sprint.
                                After those tasks are done the productowner updates the backlog. Removing tasks that
                                where
                                done, adding new ones that appeared during the sprint and changing priorities based on
                                needs.<br><br>
                                Conclusively agile methods are a way to streamline a process and effectivise it,
                                bringing
                                important factors into the process such as feedback from the product owner and getting a
                                usable product as soon as possible, which can be continously improved upon. The methods
                                are
                                also used to analyse and improve upon how the team works together.
